				<h2>Srishti Singh</h2>
				<h3> <i>Jack of all trades, master of some</i> </h3>
				<p> Hi, I am a software engineer from India who is <b>deeply</b> interested in computer vision and its application in drones and robotics. I have 2 years of professional developement experience as a software engineer working on data science and machine learning projects as well as a full-stack developer. I also have a total of 8 years of programming experience. Below is the timeline of that journey: </p> <br>  <br>
 
					In 2010, I built my first website and began my journey of programming starting with HTML, XML, C++ and SQL for next 3 years during high school. <br> <br>

					Year 2016, I spent learning full-stack web development, frontend and backend in PHP, SQL, JS, etc. <br> <br>
					
					Spring 2017, I fell in love with the book "Discrete Mathematics by Kenneth Rosen", and that's what sparked my interest to get into Data Science and I got a Hadoop certification. <br> <br>
					
					During 2015- 2018, my time time at university, I have learned C, C++, C#, Java, ARM-Assembly, digital logic design, software engineering practices, and many cool subjects as part of the course, which gives me a good overview of the whole computer science paradigm. <br> <br>

					Fall 2018, I was introduced to Machine Learning during my final year of Engineering, and ML's contribution to bio-tech, drone technology, defence and other areas is what pushed me into ML. I also spent this year learning about drone technology. <br> <br>

					<!-- But I have been in an ON & OFF relationship with Machine Learning, because of my unrequited love for pure Mathematics (especially DM), and my undying curiosity for Robotics (hardware programming), and overall an insatiable hunger for overall knowledge of computer science.
					It's a paralyzing process of constant mind battles. <br> <br> -->

					In 2019, I joined an early age startup, and worked as one of the main (and one of the only 4) developers on projects (building MVPs, POCs) involving machine learning, NLP, data science, and full stack development.  <br><br>

					Year 2021, I am on a career break, pursuing passion projects, learning computer vision and deep learning. <br> <br>
					<!--  and slightly indecisive about my next step in software engineering as a career. -->

					And I am always interested to work with motivated teams building research oriented projects, preferably in AI. <br> <br>
					
					<b>Research interest: Computer Vision, Image Processing, Real-time Video Analytics, AI for Drones and Robotics. </b> <br> <br>

As a huge fan of Tom, I built the same project, and I'll soon deploy it in cloud. </p>
